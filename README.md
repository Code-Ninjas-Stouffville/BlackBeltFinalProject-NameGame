Discription:
room in which you would be in an arcade where you can play a varity of probably licensed games(Dont sue me)you are playing as a character that is a ninja named coeyd DONT GET IT MIXED UP AS "Codey" There are a varity of games from maybe clasic to modern games, once you complete a game you will be rewarded with magical tickets where you can buy overpriced dollarstore prizes, did i say prizes i meant no prizes because we have no customers. 

Core concepts: 
Fps Bird that flys 3d :OOOOO
Codey clicker click codey
simple maze
spin wheel for "easy" tickets


TODO:
Fps Bird game(nothing to do with flappy bird) flying / basicaly standing still bird that shoots bugs, infinate ammo with limited time to complete, slow shooting gun, infinate lives/bugs just run past you/disapers maybe, bugs spawn randomly,

Codey Clicker:
Click Codey to get points, time limit every 10 cicks = 1 ticket or less time but amount of clicks = tickets. really simple game

simple maze: simple short maze with a character finding the exit, time limit,

Spin wheel: spin the wheel for "easy" tickets as most of the prizes are just one ticket
