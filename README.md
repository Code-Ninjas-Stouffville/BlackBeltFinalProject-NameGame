TODO:
Fps Bird game(nothing to do with flappy bird) flying / basicaly standing still bird that shoots bugs, infinate ammo with limited time to complete, slow shooting gun, infinate lives/bugs just run past you/disapers maybe, bugs spawn randomly,

Codey Clicker:
Click Codey to get points, time limit every 10 cicks = 1 ticket or less time but amount of clicks = tickets. really simple game

simple maze: simple short maze with a character finding the exit, time limit,

Spin wheel: spin the wheel for "easy" tickets as most of the prizes are just one ticket
